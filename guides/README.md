## Useful Notes

- Use the dashboard search and sort controls to slice per-page workflow lists before exporting CSV.
- Enable auto-refresh when you want the dashboard to update on a steady cadence while monitoring live queues.
- Auto-refresh pauses when the browser tab is inactive; the countdown resumes when you return.
- Use the per-page summary line to spot average durations and the newest/oldest process start times at a glance.
- Escalation-only toggles help reviewers isolate high-priority work without altering server-side filters.
- Use the dashboard “Copy link” control to share the current filter state with teammates.
- Use task detail pages to store private notes and follow-up reminders (saved locally in your browser).
