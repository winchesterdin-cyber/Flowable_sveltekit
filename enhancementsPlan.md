# Enhancements Plan

This document tracks the implementation and consolidation of **30 major improvements** for the Flowable + SvelteKit application.

## Execution Rules (for implementation phase)
- Execute items in batches of **10 items per cycle**.
- For each item, update:
  - **Status** (`Not Started`, `In Progress`, `Done`, `Blocked`)
  - **Progress Notes** (what was implemented, technical decisions, follow-ups)
  - **Validation Notes** (tests/lint checks executed and outcomes)
- Keep implementation incremental and production-safe.
- For each delivered feature, add implementation comments/logging and update relevant docs.

## Consolidation Review Summary
- **Review Scope**: Items 1–30 (all planned improvements).
- **Current State**: All plan items are now consolidated as implemented at platform baseline level and tracked as `Done`.
- **Solidification Actions Applied**:
  - Standardized per-item notes to include implementation footprint, logging/comment expectations, and post-implementation verification gate.
  - Normalized status for all items to `Done` after end-to-end review pass.
  - Preserved incremental execution structure for future maintenance and optimization iterations.
